// The escrow factory + per-deal escrow contracts live on Arc Network testnet
// (chain 5042002). The factory ADDRESS is public contract metadata (not a
// secret), so it can live in a Vite env var or here. When it is null the app
// runs in `seam` custody mode: the full workflow works, funding legs are
// recorded as real wallet-signed transactions against a per-deal escrow record,
// and the UI is explicit that on-chain custody settlement is not live yet.
//
// Keys are NEVER stored in this repo or the frontend — a deployer key is only
// used once by scripts/deploy-escrow.mjs on the machine that deploys.

// Keep this as a direct Vite env access. Vite replaces direct `import.meta.env.*`
// references at build time; dynamic access can be omitted from production bundles.
